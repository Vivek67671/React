        <section>
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The app allows users to order food from a variety of delicious cuisine directly to their office, as well as provide a way to track their order(s) and suggest meal combinations. The business is specific about its audience, who are the working class citizens. Most users complain about navigation, bad UI, complex checkout, and lack of order tracking. This case study focuses on improving these UX/UI challenges.</p>
